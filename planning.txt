-login.py
	For logging in and out.
	DONE.
	
- scan_card.py / scan_qr_code.py
	Takes in the card number.
	Finds the bit lenghth.
	Loops through each FC bit mask based on the bit length.
	Finds an FC match and retrieves the corrisponding card format.
	Extracts the hotstamp.
	Scans the QR and extracts the hotstamp.

- get_actdate_expdate.py
	Makes an API call to S2 with the hotstamp.
	Verify card format.
	Finds the ACTDATE, EXPDATE (if it exists).

- get_eligiblity.py
	Determine if the current date and time is greater than ACTDATE, and less than EXPDATE (if it exists).

- insert_portal_activity.py
	Make a post request to the S2 API (person was granted/denied access to portal).

- 
	Based on that set green led for 3 sec for go or red for no go.
	
Todo:
	Add config.json for all Python scripts that require logging into S2
	Write a script that makes an API requiest every 10 seconds with the same session ID and record how long it lasts (time and number of requests).
	Finish control flow of scan_card.py
	Figure out mobile scans
	Visitor pass QR scans
	DONE - Fix insert activity perms

Possible edge cases:
	Differenciate between QR scan and RFID scan
